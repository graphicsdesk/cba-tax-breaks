            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As an educational nonprofit, Columbia is exempt from nearly $170 million in property taxes each year, according to a Spectator analysis of <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Property-Exemption-Detail/muvi-b6kx">New York City Department of Finance</a> data—a cost still rising as untaxed property values climb around the burgeoning Manhattanville campus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The seven other Ivy League schools elect to make voluntary payments directly to their local governments in lieu of property taxes. Columbia, on the other hand, has long cited its 2009 West Harlem Community Benefits Agreement—a 50-page document outlining monetary commitments to the neighborhood—as its answer to local investment.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The document promises West Harlem residents $170 million in benefits administered over 36 years—averaging out to only $4.72 million annually.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Rather than directly being paid to the city government, Columbia’s CBA funds are uniquely administered by the West Harlem Development Corporation, an independent nonprofit established by the CBA.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We focus on meaningful investments that provide local jobs and economic opportunity, along with sustainable community partnerships built around the University’s intellectual capital and the work of thousands of committed faculty and students who come to Columbia for these opportunities to meaningfully serve their communities,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator in response to an inquiry about the relationship between Columbia’s community investment and tax exemptions.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia’s annual property tax exemptions, however, outpace its CBA and local infrastructure investments by more than $150 million each year, according to Spectator’s analysis.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  With the CBA’s expiration timeline nearly halfway elapsed, the University has completed only six of its commitments, according to an implementation report submitted to the state last week. Twenty-six of Columbia’s commitments are in progress, and seven obligations, including community access to a Manhattanville campus swimming pool and artist space, have not yet been “triggered” as they await further progress of the campus construction.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As the clock on the University’s CBA obligations counts down—and Manhattanville property values soar—West Harlem leaders say they hope to see Columbia give back more.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “They could do better,” Community Board 9 Chair Victor Edwards said. “For all the community space they’ve taken, I don’t think they’ve given back enough at this point. And I tell my own board members, we need to monitor it because before you know it, time will run out and what will we have to show for it?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body subhed">‘Bring them along’</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In 2008, the University owned approximately 70 percent of the land in the proposed project site for the 6.8 million square-foot Manhattanville campus expansion. The MTA and Con Edison, the largest energy provider in New York City, owned an additional 20 percent. In order to acquire the remaining 10 percent of properties on the site held by independent land owners, the University relied on private negotiations—and on the state invoking its controversial power of eminent domain.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Eminent domain, the process by which New York state seizes privately-owned land, requires that the land be for “public use,” and formally characterized by the state as “blighted.” In a commitment codified in the CBA, the University promised to exclude residential buildings and churches from its eminent domain inquiry, but included commercial property as it vied for compulsory purchase.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The use of eminent domain—of confiscating private property for private development—has contributed to a scare tactic and campaign that makes Columbia almost invincible in that it will achieve its desire to grab any and every land it so desires,” Harlem Tenants Council co-founder Nellie Bailey said <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs20080122-03.2.11&srpos=3&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Eminent+Domain------">in a 2008 interview with Spectator</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  After a series of challenges, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of New York state using eminent domain on behalf of Columbia to acquire the final parcels of land in the Manhattanville project area. Upon Columbia’s acquisition, many of these properties transferred from commercial to educational use, becoming exempt from previously applicable city and state taxes.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Thus began a yearslong negotiation with the residents of West Harlem as to how they may, in the words of the CBA, “share in the economic, educational, cultural, environmental, and social benefits associated with CU’s Manhattanville Project.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Derrick Haynes, a longtime West Harlem resident and community organizer, said that in 2007 he attended a public forum between Bollinger and the residents of West Harlem regarding the Manhattanville expansion plan. The community was not overwhelmingly opposed to the development, Haynes said, but rather concerned that “you’re not going to bring them along.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The CBA, signed by Bollinger on May 18, 2009, came as a result of these discussions, which included public hearings and meetings with West Harlem’s Community Board 9. A legally binding contract, the CBA outlined the University’s commitments to West Harlem, including up to $4 million in legal assistance, $20 million in affordable housing, and a $76 million “benefits fund” to be administered through the WHDC. In 2022, the WHDC reported distributing $1.8 million in grants to 100 West Harlem nonprofit businesses as part of its annual Community Benefits Grant.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body subhed">‘Students will pay for it’</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  David Hanzal, Manhattanville Tenants Association president and member of CB9, said affordable housing in the neighborhood is among his greatest concerns—and the CBA, he said, is failing to address the issue. Hanzal said his own apartment building rose in value from $85 million to $125 million since the Manhattanville campus construction began, displacing ​​residents who couldn’t afford rising rents.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[The Manhattanville campus expansion is] affecting people, and will continue to affect in a negative way moving forward because I’ve already seen prices go up in our neighborhood to where they were not going up like that before,” Hanzal said. “If I go 15 blocks up to the same store … it’s different prices, you know what I mean? Because they’re allowed to do that, because the students will pay for it.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Two residential buildings located at 602 W. 132nd St. and 3289 Broadway became parts of the project site. Per its CBA obligations, the University paid residents $7,000 each in relocation costs and an additional $2,000 to cover moving fees for some residents, totalling $159,000 and $63,000 respectively.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Beyond relocation fees for explicitly displaced residents, Hanzal said he was concerned that rising property values and rent prices in Manhattanville are pushing out of his neighborhood residents who are no longer able to afford mounting costs of living.
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The CBA pledged an additional $20 million toward affordable housing. As of 2021, Columbia had paid $10 million of this commitment to the WHDC, but Hanzal said CB9 has not received a more recent financial audit despite repeated requests. The WHDC did not provide a 2022 financial audit after repeated requests from Spectator. The WHDC wrote in a statement to Spectator that because the 2022 fiscal year tax deadline for tax-exempt organizations is Nov. 15, its financial documents are not yet available. But, the WHDC wrote, the organization files and makes its financial documents available on its website before the Nov. 15 deadline each year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I know that $10 million was released, but in our community, unfortunately, $10 million doesn’t get you much,” Edwards said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body subhed">‘In-Kind Benefits’</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The CBA also pledged $20 million in what the document calls “in-kind benefits,” or community access to University facilities, services, and amenities on the Manhattanville campus. Measured in “market value,” this commitment includes free public accessibility to the ground floors of all new buildings on the campus, including the Wallach Art Gallery and the Jerome L. Greene Science Center. The Forum Atrium, another ground-floor public space, frequently hosts community events and meetings, including the 26th Precinct Community Council and CB9 general council meetings.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to the WHDC’s 2021 financial audit, the most recent report available, the organization had administered only $396,179, evaluated by “fair market value,” in in-kind benefits as of December 2021. If the remaining $19,603,821 of in-kind funds are not used by 2045, the commitment will expire.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Despite the presence of University-funded programming, Hanzal said, many residents don’t know about the resources available to them.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Any of these programs, if I were to ask 10 of my neighbors in this community, I guarantee you, not a single one of them knows or has been affected by this—the benefits agreements—in a direct way, or has any knowledge of any of these programs,” Hanzal said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The University also committed to providing CB9 an office space on the project site that could “accommodate at least 50 people.” While CB9 has moved into a new space on 133rd Street and Broadway, Edwards said the office isn’t large enough to serve the 50-person board, requiring CB9 to hold its general meetings elsewhere, often in the Forum Atrium.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The city, Edwards said, pays rent to Columbia for use of the office space.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The CBA stipulates that we should have an office with office space for four and meeting space for 50. It’s meeting space for about 25 maybe,” Edwards said. “But I’m just a little dismayed that we’re not on campus at this point. I mean, you have restaurants and rock climbing and all these other things on campus, why isn’t the community board in a more visible place?”

  Beyond its explicit CBA commitments, a University spokesperson told Spectator that Columbia has consistently exceeded its targets for including minority, women, and locally-owned businesses in its construction spending—meeting its goals of 35 percent contracting and 40 percent workforce representation since 2008. In the past decade, according to the spokesperson, the University has spent more than $600 million with local firms for construction, maintenance, and repairs, which includes firms located within 13 zip codes in Upper Manhattan and four in the South Bronx.

  Though the University has met its minority, women, and locally-owned business inclusion goals, according to the University’s Manhattanville MWL Workforce and Spending Summary, between August 2008 and March 2023, only 13 percent of Manhattanville campus construction spending has gone to locally-owned firms—153 million out of Columbia’s nearly 1.2 billion in construction spending.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Employment in particular, we were concerned that with all the buildings going up on a Manhattanville campus, why didn’t we see more people from the community on the site,” Edwards said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the 15 years since 2008, the University reported paying only $2,660 to minority-owned local businesses for Manhattanville campus construction.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Still, the spokesperson told Spectator that including local businesses in campus construction remains a priority for the University. Most recently, Columbia hosted more than 70 minority, women, and locally-owned firms for an outreach event regarding the renovation of 611 W. 112th St., formerly the Maranamay hotel and the site of the University’s newest undergraduate dorm, the spokesperson said.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Since 2009, the spokesperson said, the University has also spent “upwards of $100 million” in upgrades to local infrastructure, and will “soon embark on the largest such project to date,” a replacement of two escalators at the MTA’s 125th St. station on the 1 line.

  As the CBA enters a new reporting year, Edwards said he hopes to see more transparency from the University in terms of communication with CB9 and its residents.

  Before accepting his chairship this June, Edwards served as the co-chair of the CB9’s strategic planning committee, responsible for reviewing the CBA and monitoring the success of its implementation in West Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Monitoring the University’s CBA obligations and the efficacy of the WHDC’s administration of funds remains a priority for CB9, Edwards said, especially as the expiration of the University’s CBA commitments nears.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I always say we need to do better as well, getting the word out about what’s there,” Edwards said. “As far as benefits, you know, it’s a 50-page document with a lot of different things that we can utilize, and still need to do that before it disappears.”

      <p><b>Methodology</b></p>
    
      <p>To determine the Columbia-owned properties, all exemption names containing "COLUMBIA" were collected from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Property-Exemption-Detail/muvi-b6kx">Property Exemption Detail</a> on NYC OpenData provided by the Department of Finance on October 9, 2023. These names were filtered to variations of “COLUMBIA UNI.” Annual tax savings were calculated according to each property’s current tax class and its corresponding tax rate. Columbia’s annual payments to the community were calculated by dividing the total payment by the number of years over which the payment was to be made. Completed payments were divided by the number of years since the payment was made as of 2023; cumulative payments were divided by the number of years since payments started as of 2023. If variable yearly payments were to be made over a period of years, the average amount paid was calculated. Tax rates were obtained from the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-tax-rates.page">Department of Finance</a>.</p>
